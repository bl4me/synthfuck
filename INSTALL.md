# Installation and Testing Guide

## Quick Start

### 1. Install in Firefox (Developer Mode)

1. Open Firefox
2. Navigate to `about:debugging`
3. Click "This Firefox" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
5. Navigate to this extension folder and select `manifest.json`
6. The extension should now appear in your toolbar

### 2. Test the Extension

1. Open the included `test-page.html` in Firefox
2. You should see links highlighted automatically:
   - Green highlights for regular links
   - Orange highlights with music note badges (ðŸŽµ) for Bandcamp links
3. Click the extension icon in the toolbar to open the popup
4. The popup should show:
   - Link count statistics
   - Search and filter options
   - List of all found links

### 3. Test on Real Websites

Try visiting websites with many links, such as:
- Bandcamp discovery pages
- Reddit
- News websites
- Any page with multiple links

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working?

1. **Check the Browser Console:**
   - Press F12 â†’ Console tab
   - Look for any red error messages
   - Look for messages starting with "Content script" or "Link Finder"

2. **Reload the Extension:**
   - Go to `about:debugging`
   - Find "Link Finder" and click "Reload"
   - Refresh the web page after reloading

3. **Content Script Not Injected:**
   - The extension should inject automatically
   - Try refreshing the web page
   - Check if the website blocks content scripts (like `about:` pages)

### Popup Not Showing Link Count?

This is the most common issue. Try these steps in order:

1. **Check Console for Errors:**
   - Press F12 â†’ Console tab
   - Look for messages like "Content script received message" or "Failed to load links"

2. **Verify Content Script is Loaded:**
   - In the console, type: `window.linkFinder`
   - If it returns `undefined`, the content script isn't loaded

3. **Force Content Script Injection:**
   - Open the popup
   - Click the "Refresh" button in the popup
   - This will attempt to inject the content script

4. **Test on Different Pages:**
   - Try on simple pages like the included `test-page.html`
   - Some complex websites may interfere with the extension

5. **Check Specific Error Messages:**
   - "Cannot access this tab" - Try a different website (not `about:` pages)
   - "Content script not responding" - Refresh the page and try again
   - "No active tab found" - Make sure you're on a web page

### Links Not Highlighted?

1. **Check if highlights are enabled** - click the "Highlight" button in popup
2. **Some websites may override CSS** - this is normal for sites with strong CSS
3. **Dynamic content** - the extension should detect new links automatically after 500ms
4. **Test with simple pages first** - use the included `test-page.html`

## Testing Checklist

## Development Testing

### Using the Test Page

The included `test-page.html` contains:
- Static Bandcamp links
- Static regular links
- Dynamic link addition buttons
- Various link structures

### Browser Developer Tools

1. **Content Script Debugging:**
   - Open F12 â†’ Console
   - Type `window.linkFinder` to access the LinkFinder instance
   - Use `window.linkFinder.getLinks()` to see found links

2. **Popup Debugging:**
   - Right-click on popup â†’ "Inspect Element"
   - This opens popup developer tools

3. **Background Script Debugging:**
   - Go to `about:debugging` â†’ Extension â†’ "Inspect"
   - This opens background script console

### Manual Testing Commands

In the browser console on any page:
```javascript
// Check if content script is loaded
window.linkFinder

// Get all found links
window.linkFinder.getLinks()

// Get only Bandcamp links
window.linkFinder.getBandcampLinks()

// Manually trigger scan
window.linkFinder.scanForLinks()
```

## Common Issues

### 1. "Failed to load links. Try refreshing the page."
**Most common issue - follow these steps:**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Check for JavaScript errors
- Verify the page URL is not an `about:` page or extension page
- Try on a simple website like Google or Wikipedia first
- Click "Refresh" button in the popup
- If still failing, reload the extension in `about:debugging`

### 2. "Content script not responding"
- The content script failed to initialize
- Refresh the page and wait 2-3 seconds
- Check if the website blocks content scripts
- Try a different website

### 3. "No links found" but links exist on page
- Check if page has `<a>` tags with `href` attributes
- Some single-page apps use JavaScript routing instead of real links
- Try the test page first to verify extension works
- Open console and type: `document.querySelectorAll('a[href]').length`

### 4. "Popup shows 0 links" consistently
- Most likely content script injection failure
- Go to `about:debugging` â†’ Find "Link Finder" â†’ Click "Inspect"
- Check background script console for errors
- Try uninstalling and reinstalling the extension

### 5. "Highlights not visible"
- Website CSS might be overriding extension styles
- Try toggling highlights off and on
- Check if links are actually being found (popup should show count)
- Some websites use `!important` CSS rules that override extension styles

## Performance Notes

- The extension scans pages automatically
- Large pages (1000+ links) may take a moment to process
- Dynamic content is detected with a 500ms delay
- Highlights use CSS transforms for smooth animations
